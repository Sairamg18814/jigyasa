## 🌟 What is Jigyasa?

Jigyasa represents a paradigm shift in language model design - from static, monolithic models to dynamic, self-improving systems. Built from the ground up with cutting-edge research, Jigyasa integrates:

- **🔤 Byte Latent Transformer (B.L.T.)**: Tokenizer-free architecture for universal data processing
- **🧠 Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL)**: Continuous learning through self-generated data
- **🎯 Prolonged Reinforcement Learning (ProRL)**: Advanced reasoning via extended RL training
- **🌐 Autonomous Data Engine**: Web-scale data acquisition without human intervention
- **🤔 Self-Correction**: "Think before answering" with verification mechanisms
- **⚖️ Constitutional AI**: Embedded ethical governance for safe operation
- **💻 On-Device Optimization**: Compressed models that run on laptops

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install jigyasa
```

### Interactive Demo

```bash
# Quick demonstration
python scripts/quick_start.py

# Full interactive mode
jigyasa interactive
```

### Simple Usage

```python
from jigyasa import JigyasaSystem

# Initialize the system
system = JigyasaSystem()
system.initialize()

# Experience self-correction in action
result = system.self_correction.think_before_answer(
    query="What are the implications of quantum computing for cryptography?",
    query_type="analytical"
)

# See the thinking process
print("🤔 Thinking Process:")
print(result['thinking_process'])

print("\n✅ Final Answer:")
print(result['final_response'])

print(f"\n📊 Confidence: {result['confidence_score']:.2f}")
```

### 🔬 Core Innovations

#### Byte Latent Transformer (B.L.T.)
- **No tokenization**: Processes raw bytes for universal compatibility
- **Dynamic patching**: Entropy-based segmentation for efficient computation
- **Pan-lingual**: Handles any language, code, or data format seamlessly

#### Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL)
- **Autonomous learning**: Generates its own training data
- **Continuous adaptation**: Updates weights based on new information
- **Meta-learning**: Learns how to learn more effectively

#### Prolonged Reinforcement Learning (ProRL)
- **Extended training**: Thousands of RL steps for novel reasoning
- **KL control**: Prevents entropy collapse during exploration
- **Verifiable tasks**: 136K+ problems with correct answers

#### Self-Correction System
- **Chain-of-Verification**: Generates questions to check its own work
- **Reverse Chain-of-Thought**: Works backwards to verify reasoning
- **Self-Refine**: Iterative improvement through self-critique
