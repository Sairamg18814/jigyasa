    for i in range(len(data)):
        if data[i] > 0:
            results.append(data[i] * 2)
    return results

# Into this optimized version:
@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def fast_function(data: tuple) -> list:
    """Auto-optimized by JIGYASA"""
    try:
        items_array = np.array(data)
        positive_mask = items_array > 0
        return (items_array[positive_mask] * 2).tolist()
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error: {e}")
        raise
