## 🚀 Overview

**JIGYASA** (Sanskrit for "curiosity" or "desire to know") is an advanced AGI system that combines multiple cutting-edge AI techniques to create a self-improving, continuously learning artificial intelligence that can reason, reflect, and adapt.

### Key Capabilities

- 🤔 **Self-Correcting Reasoning**: Thinks before answering using Chain-of-Verification
- 📚 **Continuous Learning**: Adapts to new information without forgetting (SEAL)
- 🧮 **Advanced Reasoning**: Discovers new reasoning patterns autonomously (ProRL)
- 🎯 **Goal-Oriented Planning**: Breaks down complex tasks systematically
- 🛡️ **Constitutional AI Safety**: Built-in safety measures and ethical guidelines
- 📦 **Efficient Deployment**: Compressed models that run on consumer hardware

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- 8GB+ RAM recommended
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional, for faster training)

### Quick Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jigyasa.git
cd jigyasa

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r jigyasa/requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your tokens
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with:
```env
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token  # Optional
```

## 🎮 Quick Start

### 1. Interactive Mode (Recommended for First Time)

```bash
python run_jigyasa.py --mode interactive
```

<details>
<summary>Example Interaction</summary>

```
🧠 Jigyasa Interactive Mode
==================================================
You: What is the square root of 144?

🤔 Thinking...

💭 Thinking Process:
------------------------------
Initial Reasoning:
Generated response: The square root of 144 is 12...

Verification Process:
- Generated 3 verification questions
- Q1: Is 12 × 12 = 144?
- A1: Yes, 12 × 12 = 144
- No inconsistencies detected

Final Confidence: 0.95

✅ Final Answer:
------------------------------
The square root of 144 is 12.

📊 Confidence: 0.95
```

</details>

### 2. Training Pipeline

```bash
# Run the complete training pipeline
python run_jigyasa.py --mode train
```

This will execute:
1. **Phase 1**: Foundational ProRL training
2. **Phase 2**: Continuous SEAL learning
3. **Phase 3**: Model compression for deployment

### 3. Python API

```python
from jigyasa.config import JigyasaConfig
from jigyasa.main import JigyasaSystem

# Initialize system
config = JigyasaConfig()
system = JigyasaSystem(config)
system.initialize()

# Think before answering
result = system.self_correction.think_before_answer(
    query="Explain quantum entanglement",
    query_type="analytical"
)

print(result['final_response'])
```
