## üß† A Self-Improving Artificial General Intelligence System

JIGYASA (Sanskrit for "curiosity" or "desire to know") represents a paradigm shift in AI development - from static models to dynamic, self-improving systems that learn continuously and think before they answer.

- :material-brain:{ .lg .middle } **Cognitive Architecture**

    ---

    Advanced multi-layer reasoning system with self-correction, meta-learning, and neuro-symbolic integration

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](architecture/cognitive.md)

- :material-school:{ .lg .middle } **Continuous Learning**

    ---

    SEAL (Self-Evolving Active Learning) enables adaptation to new information without catastrophic forgetting

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Explore SEAL](features/continuous-learning.md)

- :material-shield-check:{ .lg .middle } **Constitutional AI**

    ---

    Built-in safety measures and ethical guidelines ensure responsible AI behavior

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Safety features](features/safety.md)

- :material-rocket-launch:{ .lg .middle } **Easy Deployment**

    ---

    Compressed models (~500MB) that run efficiently on consumer hardware

## Quick Example

Experience JIGYASA's unique "think before answering" capability:

```python
from jigyasa import JigyasaSystem

# Initialize the system
system = JigyasaSystem()
system.initialize()

# Ask a complex question
result = system.self_correction.think_before_answer(
    query="What are the ethical implications of AGI development?",
    query_type="analytical"
)

# See the thinking process
print("üí≠ Thinking Process:")
print(result['thinking_process'])

print("\n‚úÖ Final Answer:")
print(result['final_response'])

print(f"\nüìä Confidence: {result['confidence_score']:.2f}")
```

## Key Features

### ü§î Self-Correcting Reasoning
- **Chain-of-Verification (CoVe)**: Generates questions to verify its own answers
- **Reverse Chain-of-Thought**: Works backwards to validate reasoning
- **Self-Refine**: Iteratively improves responses through self-critique

### üìö Advanced Learning Capabilities
- **ProRL**: Discovers new reasoning strategies through reinforcement learning
- **SEAL**: Continuously adapts to new information
- **Meta-Learning**: Learns how to learn more effectively

### üî¨ Technical Innovations
- **Byte-Level Transformer (B.L.T)**: Tokenizer-free architecture
- **Dynamic Patching**: Entropy-based segmentation
- **Model Compression**: Knowledge distillation + quantization
